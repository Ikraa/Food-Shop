                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beef bacon is exactly what it sounds: It's bacon made from beef instead of pork. Pork bacon is simply cured, smoked, and sliced pork belly. Similarly, beef bacon is made by curing, drying, smoking, and then thinly slicing beef belly. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized </p> </div>
